# Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming

# How to use OOP (Class and Objects)
# Example: The Restaurant has three modul, W
# Module Waiter:
# has => is_holding_plate = True, and tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]    ===> attributes
# does => def take_order(table, order):  and def take_payment(amount):  ===> methods
# Objects are a combination of some attributes and some methods in the same thing
# We can generate multiple objects in the same type as a Class

# Constructing Object
# Class = blueprint of a car, Object = car
# car = CarBlueprint()
# Object = car, Class = CarBlueprint()

# car.speed = object.attributes
# car.stop() = object.method
